# Virtual Network Lab

## Objective

This Detection Lab project aims to create a simulated environment for testing and analyzing a range of cybersecurity threats. The lab will facilitate hands-on experience in threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring by setting up various attack scenarios. This project aims to improve the ability to identify vulnerabilities, respond to security breaches, and analyze attack vectors effectively, preparing for real-world cybersecurity challenges.

### Skills obtained 
- Threat detection and analysis techniques
- Incident response and forensic analysis
- Network traffic monitoring and packet analysis
- Log analysis and event correlation
- Development of custom detection rules and alerts
- Security vulnerability identification and remediation
