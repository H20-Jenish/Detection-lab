# Detection Lab

## Objective

The goal of this Detection Lab project is to create a simulated environment for testing and analyzing a range of cybersecurity threats. By setting up various attack scenarios, the lab will facilitate hands-on experience in threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring. This project aims to improve the ability to identify vulnerabilities, respond to security breaches, and analyze attack vectors effectively, preparing for real-world cybersecurity challenges

### Skills Learned
- Threat detection and analysis techniques
- Incident response and forensic analysis
- Network traffic monitoring and packet analysis
- Log analysis and event correlation
- Development of custom detection rules and alerts
- Security vulnerability identification and remediation

### Tools Used
- Splunk: For security information and event management (SIEM), log aggregation, and analysis.
- Wireshark: For network traffic analysis and packet capture.
- Kali Linux: For penetration testing and ethical hacking tools.
- Snort/Suricata: For intrusion detection and prevention systems.
- Metasploit: For exploiting vulnerabilities and testing defenses.
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): For advanced log analysis and visualization.
