# 2.0 Active Directory Security

### Objective  
To enhance the security of the Active Directory (AD) environment by implementing policies, monitoring traffic, and mitigating risks. The focus is on ensuring robust access control, detecting potential threats, and responding to attacks targeting AD infrastructure.

### Skills Learned  
- Secure Active Directory configuration and management.  
- Detecting and mitigating common AD vulnerabilities.  
- Implementing access control measures using Group Policy.  
- Analyzing attack patterns and defending against directory-based attacks.

### Tools Used  
- **AD Server22**: Active Directory services for user and device management.  
- **Wazuh**: Endpoint monitoring and log management.  
- **Security Onion**: Network traffic analysis for detecting threats.  
- **Kali Linux (Hacker)**: Simulating attacks on the AD infrastructure.  
- **pfsense**: Network firewall and routing.  
- **Windows 11/10 Pro**: Endpoints for testing user policies.

### Steps  
1. Configure the AD server in the **AD Zone** using Server22 to manage domains and users.  
2. Set up Group Policies (e.g., password complexity, lockout policies) and link them to Organizational Units (OUs).  
3. Use **Wazuh** to monitor AD logs for unusual activities such as failed login attempts or privilege escalations.  
4. Simulate attacks from the **Kali (Hacker)** machine, such as pass-the-hash or credential dumping.  
5. Analyze attack traffic using **Security Onion** to identify potential entry points.  
6. Harden security measures based on findings, such as restricting NTLM usage and enforcing LDAP signing.  
7. Test the applied security policies by attempting unauthorized access from a compromised endpoint (e.g., Windows 10 Pro).
