# 7.0 File Storage Security

## Objective

To demonstrate the implementation of secure file storage practices in a networked environment, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability while mitigating potential cybersecurity risks. This lab simulates real-world scenarios involving secure file access, monitoring, and threat detection.

## Skills Learned

1. Configuring secure file storage using TrueNAS.
2. Implementing access control mechanisms, including authentication and authorization.
3. Monitoring file storage activities for anomalies using Wazuh.
4. Applying encryption techniques for data at rest and in transit.
5. Integrating file storage with Active Directory for user authentication.
6. Identifying and mitigating common storage-related threats, such as unauthorized access and data leakage.

## Tools Used
1. TrueNAS: For setting up and managing the file storage system.
2. Active Directory (AD): For user and group management and authentication.
3. Wazuh: For monitoring file access and detecting security anomalies.
4. Kali Linux: For simulating penetration testing and exploiting file storage vulnerabilities.
5. Security Onion: For analyzing network traffic related to storage access.
6. pfsense: For configuring network segmentation and firewall rules to protect file storage zones.

## Steps

### 1. Lab Initialization:

- Configure the network layout as per the provided design, ensuring proper segmentation of zones (e.g., AD Zone, Security Zone, DMZ Zone, Isolated Zone).
- Deploy TrueNAS in the Isolated Zone for secure file storage.

### 2. Setting Up File Storage:

- Install and configure TrueNAS with appropriate RAID settings to ensure redundancy.
- Create storage pools and datasets based on organizational needs.
- Enable file sharing services (SMB, NFS) with secure configurations.

### 3. User Authentication:

- Integrate TrueNAS with Active Directory for centralized user authentication.
- Define user groups and set granular permissions for accessing specific datasets.

### 4. Data Security Measures:

- Configure encryption for data at rest using TrueNAS features.
- Enable SSL/TLS for data in transit during file access.

### 5. Monitoring and Logging:

- Set up Wazuh to monitor file access logs from TrueNAS.
- Create alerts for unauthorized access attempts or abnormal activity.

### 6. Penetration Testing and Threat Simulation:

- Use Kali Linux to attempt unauthorized access to file storage.
- Validate the effectiveness of security measures by analyzing logs and alerts in Wazuh and Security Onion.

### 7. Network Security:

- Use pfsense to create firewall rules restricting access to the file storage system.
- Enable logging on pfsense to monitor traffic patterns to and from the storage system.

### 8. Documentation and Reporting:

- Document all configurations, observed security events, and mitigation measures.
- Prepare a report highlighting the security posture and recommendations for improvement.
