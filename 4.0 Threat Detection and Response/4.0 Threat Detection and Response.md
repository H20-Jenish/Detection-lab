# Threat Detection and Response Virtual Lab

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to demonstrate proficiency in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating cybersecurity threats within a simulated enterprise network environment. This setup replicates real-world network scenarios to improve hands-on knowledge of threat detection and response.



## Skills Learned
1. Implementing and configuring threat monitoring and detection tools.  
2. Analyzing security alerts and logs for malicious activities.  
3. Responding to identified threats through containment and remediation techniques.  
4. Managing and monitoring network traffic across isolated zones and VLANs.  
5. Securing endpoints and servers against potential vulnerabilities.  



## Tools Used
- Security Onion: For network traffic analysis and threat hunting.  
- Wazuh: For log management and endpoint detection and response (EDR).  
- Kali Linux: For vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.  
- PFsense: For network segmentation and firewall management.  
- Wireshark: For deep packet inspection and network analysis.  
- TrueNAS: For secure file storage and access control.  



## Steps

1. Network Layout Setup:  
   - Configured segmented zones: AD Zone, DMZ Zone, Security Zone, Guest Zone, and Isolated Zone using PFsense for VLAN management.  
   - Established communication between servers (Active Directory, IIS Server) and endpoints (Windows 10 Pro, Windows 11 Pro).  

2. Deploy Security Monitoring Tools:  
   - Installed Security Onion for network-wide monitoring and alert generation.  
   - Deployed Wazuh agents across servers and endpoints for log collection and EDR capabilities.  

3. Threat Simulation:  
   - Used Kali Linux to simulate various attack scenarios, including phishing attempts, malware injection, and lateral movement across zones.  
   - Analyzed the generated alerts on Security Onion and Wazuh dashboards.  

4. Response Actions:  
   - Investigated alerts and verified malicious activities using packet captures and logs.  
   - Implemented remediation measures such as isolating compromised endpoints and updating firewall rules in PFsense.  

5. Reporting:  
   - Documented detected threats, response actions, and lessons learned to improve overall security posture.
