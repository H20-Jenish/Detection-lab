# Network Security Architecture

## 1. Objective
To design and implement a secure network architecture that simulates a real-world enterprise environment. The goal is to demonstrate the segmentation of networks into various zones, such as AD Zone, DMZ Zone, Guest Zone, Security Zone, and Isolated Zone, ensuring robust protection against internal and external threats.

## 2. Skills Learned
- Network segmentation and isolation for enhanced security.
- Configuration and management of a firewall (pfSense) for inter-zone traffic control.
- Implementation of intrusion detection and prevention systems.
- Hardening of servers and endpoints within AD_zones, DMZ_Zone and Isolated_Zone.
- Analysis of network traffic through a SPAN port for security monitoring.

## 3. Tools Used
- **pfSense**: Firewall and network gateway.
- **Security Onion**: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and network monitoring.
- **Kali Linux**: Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.
- **Wazuh**: Host-based security monitoring.
- **IIS Server**: Web hosting in the DMZ Zone.
- **TrueNAS**: Network-attached storage.
- **REMux and Flare VM**: Malware analysis tools.
- **Active Directory (AD)**: Centralized domain and user management.
- **Windows 10/11 Pro**: Client systems for simulation.

## 4. Steps

1. **Setup and Configuration of pfSense Firewall**
   - Configure pfSense with sub-interfaces for each network zone:
     - AD Zone: `10.10.10.0/24`
     - Security Zone: `10.10.50.0/24`
     - DMZ Zone: `10.10.99.0/24`
     - Guest Zone: `10.10.20.0/24`
     - Isolated Zone: `10.10.1.0/28`
   - Define inter-zone traffic rules to restrict unauthorized access.

2. **Deploy and Configure Systems in Zones**
   - Place Windows AD Server and clients in the AD Zone.
   - Deploy Wazuh and Security Onion in the Security Zone for monitoring and logging AD_zones and DMZ_Zone traffic.
   - Host IIS Server, linux webserver and TrueNAS in the DMZ_Zone to simulate an internet-facing application.
   - Allow restricted access to the Guest Zone for external users.

3. **Enable Traffic Monitoring and IDS**
   - Use Security Onion to monitor traffic from the SPAN port for threat detection.
   - Configure alerts for anomalous traffic patterns.

4. **Test Network Security**
   - Use Kali Linux to simulate attacks and test firewall rules and IDS effectiveness.
   - Perform vulnerability scans and document findings.

5. **Document and Analyze Results**
   - Review logs from Wazuh and Security Onion.
   - Generate a report summarizing network vulnerabilities, attack simulations, and mitigation strategies.
