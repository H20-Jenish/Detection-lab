# Network Security Architecture

## 1. Objective
To design and implement a secure network architecture that simulates a real-world enterprise environment. This includes developing secure network topologies into various zones, such as AD Zone, DMZ Zone, Guest Zone, Security Zone, and Isolated zone, enforcing access controls, implementing threat detection mechanisms, and ensuring compliance with industry security frameworks. By integrating firewalls, intrusion detection systems, VPNs, and zero-trust principles, the goal is to create resilient network defences against internal and external threats.

## 2. Skills Learned
- Network segmentation and isolation for enhanced security.
- Configuration and management of a firewall (pfSense) for inter-zone traffic control.
- Implementation of intrusion detection systems and log analyzer.
- Hardening of servers and endpoints within AD_zones, DMZ_Zone and Isolated_Zone.
- Analysis of network traffic with Suricata and Snort through a SPAN port for security monitoring.

## 3. Tools Used
- **pfSense**: Firewall and network gateway.
- **Wazuh/Kali Purple-ELK**: Host-based security monitoring.
- **Ubuntu(Suricata/Snort)**: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and network monitoring.
- **Kali Linux**: Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.

## 4. Steps

1. **Setup and Configuration of pfSense Firewall**
   - Configure pfSense with sub-interfaces for each network zone and Define inter-zone traffic rules to restrict unauthorized access:
     - AD Zone: `10.10.10.0/24` <br>
       ![AD_Zone_Rules](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df4d2ca3-3034-4d64-988e-5c0e64075419)
     - Security Zone: `10.10.50.0/24`
       ![Security_Zone_Rules](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a27befe-0cd4-41cd-a73e-8395fcc10620)
     - DMZ Zone: `10.10.99.0/24'
       ![DMZ_Zone_Rules](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df01a0bb-e32a-4417-94c1-1778b79c1618)
     - Guest Zone: `10.10.20.0/24`
       ![Guest_Zone_Rules](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4f8c68b-abc7-406a-834f-ecf9f88707bd)
     - Isolated Zone: `10.10.1.0/28`
       ![Isolate_Zone_Rules](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e601a40b-92b2-4974-9508-37a996e30549)
  
2. **Deploy and Configure Systems in Zones**
   - Place Windows AD Server and clients in the AD Zone.
   - Deploy Wazuh and Elasticsearch in the Security Zone for monitoring and logging AD_Zone and DMZ_Zone traffic.
   - Host IIS Server, linux webserver and TrueNAS in the DMZ_Zone to simulate an internet-facing application.
   - Allow restricted access to the Guest Zone for external users.

3. **Enable Traffic Monitoring and IDS**
   - Use Suricata to monitor traffic from the SPAN port for threat detection.
     - Suricata Logs
     ![Suricata_logs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3459d4d7-4e51-4705-a9fe-2d80bc6f48d1)
   - Configure alerts for anomalous traffic patterns.

4. **Test Network Security**
   - Use Kali Linux to simulate attacks and test firewall rules and IDS effectiveness.
   - Perform vulnerability scans and document findings with OpneVAS Vulnerability scanner: - 
      - DMZ_Zone assessment

      - AD_Zone Assessment
        [AD_Subnet.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18923971/AD_Subnet.pdf)

5. **Document and Analyze Results**
   - Review logs from Wazuh and Kali Purple/ELK Server.
   - Generate a report summarizing network vulnerabilities, attack simulations, and mitigation strategies.
