# 6.0 System and Network Hardening

## Objective
To demonstrate skills and knowledge in securing systems and networks by implementing hardening techniques. This involves reducing vulnerabilities, configuring security controls, and improving overall cybersecurity posture within a virtual lab environment.

## Skills Learned
1. System Hardening:
   - Applying security configurations to operating systems (Windows Server, Windows 10 Pro, and CentOS).
   - Disabling unnecessary services and ports.
   - Enforcing strong password policies and user access controls.
2. Network Hardening:
   - Configuring firewalls (pfSense) for network segmentation.
   - Establishing secure zones (AD Zone, Security Zone, DMZ Zone).
   - Implementing intrusion detection/prevention systems (Security Onion, Wazuh).
3. Vulnerability Management:
   - Identifying and remediating system vulnerabilities using tools like Nessus and Flare VM.
4. Monitoring and Logging:
   - Setting up centralized log collection and monitoring (Wazuh and Security Onion).
   - Using span ports to capture and analyze traffic for suspicious activity.
5. Secure Software Deployment:
   - Hardening web servers (IIS Server) and securing data storage systems (TrueNAS).

## Tools Used
- Network Infrastructure:
  - pfSense (Firewall and Network Segmentation)
  - REMux (Traffic analysis)
- Monitoring & Detection:
  - Security Onion
  - Wazuh
- Attack Simulation:
  - Kali Linux (Penetration Testing)
  - Hacker Machine
- Operating Systems:
  - Windows 11 Pro, Windows 10 Pro
  - CentOS
  - AD Server (Active Directory management)
- Storage:
  - TrueNAS
- Vulnerability Analysis:
  - Flare VM (Windows-based pentesting)
  - Nessus
- Other Servers:
  - IIS Server (Web Server)

## Steps
1. Network Configuration:
   - Designed a segmented network with zones (AD Zone, Security Zone, DMZ Zone, Isolated Zone).
   - Configured pfSense to manage network traffic and apply strict access controls.
   - Established isolated VLANs for better containment of potential threats.

2. System Hardening:
   - Applied baseline security configurations on Windows and Linux systems.
   - Configured group policies in Active Directory to enforce secure authentication and audit log policies.
   - Disabled unnecessary services and ports on servers.

3. Vulnerability Scanning and Patching:
   - Conducted vulnerability scans using Nessus to identify system weaknesses.
   - Patched identified vulnerabilities and documented remediations.

4. Monitoring and Logging:
   - Deployed Wazuh for endpoint monitoring and centralized log analysis.
   - Configured Security Onion to detect network anomalies and respond to security incidents.

5. Web Server Security:
   - Hardened IIS Server by disabling directory browsing, enabling HTTPS, and configuring application pools.
   - Implemented security headers to mitigate web-based attacks.

6. Testing Security Posture:
   - Used Kali Linux to simulate real-world attacks on hardened systems to validate security measures.
   - Analyzed logs and alerts from Wazuh and Security Onion to detect and respond to these attacks.

7. Backup and Recovery:
   - Configured TrueNAS for secure data storage and backup.
   - Tested recovery procedures to ensure data integrity in case of incidents.
