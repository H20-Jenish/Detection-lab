# 3.0 Penetration Testing.

The virtual lab, as depicted in the uploaded network layout, demonstrates a segmented and isolated environment that mirrors real-world corporate IT infrastructures. It is built to enhance cybersecurity skills, incorporating zones like DMZ, Security Zone, and AD Zone to replicate layered defenses. Critical components include Active Directory servers, monitoring tools like Wazuh and Security Onion, and attack simulation nodes like Kali Linux.

## Lab Topic: Penetration Testing

### Objective  
To assess the security posture of the virtual environment by simulating real-world attack scenarios. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them to demonstrate potential risks, and recommend appropriate mitigations.

### Skills Learned  
- Conducting reconnaissance using active and passive methods.  
- Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in network services and systems.  
- Performing privilege escalation on compromised hosts.  
- Documenting findings and creating remediation strategies.

### Tools Used  
- **Kali Linux**: Primary platform for penetration testing.  
- **Metasploit Framework**: Exploit development and testing.  
- **Nmap**: Network discovery and vulnerability scanning.  
- **Burp Suite**: Web application security testing.  
- **Wireshark**: Network traffic analysis.  
- **pfsense**: Simulating firewall bypass techniques.  
- **Flare VM**: Malware analysis and reverse engineering.

### Steps  
1. Perform network reconnaissance using **Nmap** to identify live hosts, open ports, and services running on the network.  
2. Conduct vulnerability assessments on identified services using tools like **Metasploit** and **Nessus**.  
3. Exploit vulnerabilities on target machines, such as the **IIS Server22** or **Windows 10 Pro**, to gain initial access.  
4. Escalate privileges on compromised systems using known exploits or misconfigurations.  
5. Test lateral movement across the network, including accessing resources in the **AD Zone** or **DMZ Zone**.  
6. Capture and analyze network traffic using **Wireshark** to detect sensitive data leakage or misconfigurations.  
7. Simulate a web application attack using **Burp Suite** on a hosted web server in the DMZ.  
8. Document findings, including screenshots of successful exploits, and provide mitigation strategies to secure vulnerabilities.
