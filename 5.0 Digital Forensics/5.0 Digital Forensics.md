# 5.0 Digital Forensics 

## Objective
To simulate a real-world cybersecurity incident for demonstrating forensic investigation techniques, uncovering malicious activities, and preserving evidence in alignment with cybersecurity best practices.

## Skills Learned
- Understanding the forensic investigation process, including data acquisition, analysis, and reporting.  
- Identifying and preserving digital evidence from compromised systems.  
- Analyzing log files, disk images, and network traffic for malicious activities.  
- Employing tools to detect and trace the origin of security incidents.  
- Documenting findings and reporting them systematically.  

## Tools Used
- Security Onion: For network monitoring and packet capture analysis.  
- Wazuh: To monitor system logs and detect anomalies.  
- Kali Linux: For forensic analysis and utilities like Autopsy, Sleuth Kit, and Volatility.  
- Flare VM: For reverse engineering and malware analysis.  
- TrueNAS: For secure storage of forensic evidence.  
- pfsense: To simulate network traffic and isolate zones for investigation.  
- REMux: For analyzing memory dumps and artifacts from compromised systems.  

## Steps
1. Incident Simulation: A mock attack was executed in the GUEST_ZONE, targeting the Windows 10 Pro machine. Suspicious behavior was logged by Wazuh.  
2. Evidence Collection:  
   - Captured packet traffic using Security Onion.  
   - Retrieved system logs and event history from the targeted machine.  
   - Acquired a disk image and memory dump from the compromised host.  
3. Preliminary Analysis:  
   - Used Autopsy and Sleuth Kit on Kali Linux to analyze the disk image.  
   - Examined network traffic for anomalies using Security Onion tools like Zeek and Suricata.  
4. Deep Dive:  
   - Performed reverse engineering of a suspicious executable using Flare VM.  
   - Utilized Volatility for memory forensics to identify processes and potential rootkits.  
5. Documentation:  
   - Compiled evidence into a comprehensive report, detailing findings, timelines, and the impact of the incident.  
   - Suggested remediation measures to prevent similar attacks.
